# {SampleName}

***Replace {SampleName} with the name of your sample. A connector must have at least one sample to demonstrate that it works with Bonsai.***

> Describe your sample. What is it that it simulates?

## States

> Describe the simulation's state variables. A table can be a good way to document this. For example:
> | State                    | Range         | Notes |
> | ------------------------ | ------------- | ----- |
> | QuantityA                | [-2.4..2.4]   | Quantity of A in the hoppers. |
> | PositionB                | [-Inf..Inf]   | Position of B. |

## Actions

> Describe the simulation's action variables. A table can be a good way to document this.

## Configuration Parameters

> Describe the settings that are used to initialize the simulation. A table can be a good way to document this.

## Usage: Running a local simulator

> Describe how to execute the simulation as a local Bonsai simulator. For example, this could include an example command-line argument for doing so.
>
> This is similar to the information from *Usage: Running a local simulator* in the [main README.md](../../README.md) It is helpful to have this as a quick-reference here for a user who just wants to quickly up and running with this specific sample.
