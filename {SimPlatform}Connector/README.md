# {SimPlatform}Connector

> This directory will contain the source code and other files that implement the connector.

> Optional: This README.md file can describe the architecture of the connector source code and highlight important context for someone new learning the codebase. Alternatively, if the architecture is self-explanatory or is already documented in comments within the source files themselves then this README.md file can be deleted.
